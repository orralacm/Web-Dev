    <h1>JavaScript Object Properties</h1>

    <p>Properties are the most important part of any JavaScript object.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript Properties</h2>

    <p>Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.</p>
    <p>A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.</p>
    <p>Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.</p>

    <h2>Accessing JavaScript Properties</h2>

    <p>The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:</p>
    <p style="font-family: courier;">objectName.property         // person.age</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p style="font-family: courier;">objectName["property"]      // person["age"]</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p style="font-family: courier;">objectName[expression]      // x = "age"; person[x]</p>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: 500px;">The expression must evaluate to a property name.</p>

    <p>There are two different ways to access an object property:</p>
    <p>You can use .property or ["property"].</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        var person = {
        firstname:"John",
        lastname:"Doe",
        age:50,
        eyecolor:"blue"
        };

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
    </script>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <script>
        var person2 = {
        firstname:"John",
        lastname:"Doe",
        age:50,
        eyecolor:"blue"
        };

        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = person2["firstname"] + " is " + person2["age"] + " years old.";
    </script>

    <h2>JavaScript for...in Loop</h2>

    <p>The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an object.</p>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <pre style="font-family: courier;">
        for (variable in object) {
          // code to be executed
        }
    </pre>

    <p>The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each property.</p>
    <p>Looping through the properties of an object:</p>

    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <script>
        var txt = "";
        var person3 = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; 
        var x;
        for (x in person3) {
        txt += person3[x] + " ";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = txt;
    </script>

    <h2>Adding New Properties</h2>

    <p>You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.</p>
    <p>Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give it new properties:</p>

    <p id="demo4"></p>

    <script>
        var person4 = {
        firstname:"John",
        lastname:"Doe",
        age:50,
        eyecolor:"blue"
        };

        person4.nationality = "English";
        document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML =
        person4.firstname + " is " + person4.nationality + ".";
    </script>

    <h2>Deleting Properties</h2>

    <p>The delete keyword deletes a property from an object:</p>

    <p id="demo5"></p>

    <script>
        var person5 = {
        firstname:"John",
        lastname:"Doe",
        age:50,
        eyecolor:"blue"
        };

        delete person5.age;
        document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML =
        person5.firstname + " is " + person5.age + " years old.";
    </script>

    <p>The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.</p>
    <p>After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.</p>
    <p>The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or functions.</p>
    <p>The delete operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. It can crash your application.</p>

    <h2>Property Attributes</h2>

    <p>All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value.</p>
    <p>The value is one of the property's attributes.</p>
    <p>Other attributes are: enumerable, configurable, and writable.</p>
    <p>These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?)</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable).</p>
    <p>( ECMAScript 5 has methods for both getting and setting all property attributes)</p>

    <h2>Prototype Properties</h2>

    <p>JavaScript objects inherit the properties of their prototype.</p>
    <p>The delete keyword does not delete inherited properties, but if you delete a prototype property, it will affect all objects inherited from the prototype.</p>
