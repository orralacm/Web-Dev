    <h1>JavaScript For Loop</h1>

    <p>Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript Loops</h2>

    <p>Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.</p>

    <p>Often this is the case when working with arrays.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        var cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford", "Fiat", "Audi"];
        var text = "";
        var i;
        for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
        text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <h2>Different Kinds of Loops</h2>

    <p>JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
        <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
        <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
        <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
        <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The For Loop</h2>

    <p>The for loop has the following syntax:</p>

    <p>Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.</p>
    <p>Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.</p>
    <p>Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.</p>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <script>
        var text = "";
        var i;
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <p>From the example above, you can read:</p>
    <p>Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).</p>
    <p>Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).</p>
    <p>Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.</p>

    <h3>Statement 1</h3>

    <p>Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (i = 0).<br>
    This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 1 is optional.<br>
    You can initiate many values in statement 1 (separated by comma):</p>

    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <script>
        var cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
        var i, len, text;
        for (i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) {
        text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <p>And you can omit statement 1 (like when your values are set before the loop starts):</p>

    <p id="demo4"></p>

    <script>
        var cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
        var i = 2;
        var len = cars.length;
        var text = "";

        for (; i < len; i++) {
        text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        }

        document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <h3>Statement 2</h3>

    <p>Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable.<br>
    This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 2 is also optional.<br>        
    If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end.</p>

    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: 500px;">If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser. Read about breaks in a later chapter of this tutorial.</p>

    <h3>Statement 3</h3>

    <p>Often statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable.<br>
    This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional.<br>        
    Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else.<br>
    Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop):</p>

    <p id="demo5"></p>

    <script>
        var cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];

        var i = 0;
        var len = cars.length;
        var text = "";

        for (; i < len; ) {
        text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        i++;
        }
        document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = text;
    </script>
