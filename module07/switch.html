    <h1>JavaScript Switch Statement</h1>

    <p>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>

    <h2>The JavaScript Switch Statement</h2>

    <p>Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.</p>

    <p>This is how it works:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The switch expression is evaluated once.</li>
        <li>The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.</li>
        <li>If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.</li>
        <li>If there is no match, the default code block is executed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.<br>
        This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        var day;
        switch (new Date().getDay()) {
        case 0:
            day = "Sunday";
            break;
        case 1:
            day = "Monday";
            break;
        case 2:
            day = "Tuesday";
            break;
        case 3:
            day = "Wednesday";
            break;
        case 4:
            day = "Thursday";
            break;
        case 5:
            day = "Friday";
            break;
        case  6:
            day = "Saturday";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Today is " + day;
    </script>

    <h2>The break Keyword</h2>

    <p>When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.<br>
    This will stop the execution inside the switch block.<br>
    It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.</p>

    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: 500px;">Note: If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.</p>

    <h2>The default Keyword</h2>

    <p>The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:</p>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <script>
        var text;
        switch (new Date().getDay()) {
        case 6:
            text = "Today is Saturday";
            break;
        case 0:
            text = "Today is Sunday";
            break;
        default:
            text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <p>The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block:</p>

    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <script>
        var text;
        switch (new Date().getDay()) {
        default:
            text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
            break;
        case 6:
            text = "Today is Saturday";
            break;
        case 0:
            text = "Today is Sunday";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: 500px;">If default is not the last case in the switch block, remember to end the default case with a break.</p>

    <h2>Common Code Blocks</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you will want different switch cases to use the same code.</p>

    <p>In this example case 4 and 5 share the same code block, and 0 and 6 share another code block:

    <p id="demo4"></p>

    <script>
        var text;
        switch (new Date().getDay()) {
            case 4:
            case 5:
            text = "Soon it is Weekend";
            break;
            case 0:
            case 6:
            text = "It is Weekend";
            break;
            default:
            text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
        }
    document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <h2>Switching Details</h2>

    <p>If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected.</p>
    <p>If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label.</p>
    <p>If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch.</p>

    <h2>Strict Comparison</h2>

    <p>Switch cases use strict comparison (===).</p>
    <p>The values must be of the same type to match.</p>
    <p>A strict comparison can only be true if the operands are of the same type.</p>
    <p>In this example there will be no match for x:</p>

    <p id="demo5"></p>

    <script>
        var x = "0";

        switch (x) {
        case 0:
            text = "Off";
            break;
        case 1:
            text = "On";
            break;
        default:
            text = "No value found";
        }
        document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

</body>
