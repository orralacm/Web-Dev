    <h1>JavaScript Debugging</h1>

    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: 500px;">Errors can (will) happen, every time you write some new computer code.</p>

    <h2>Code Debugging</h2>

    <p>Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors.</p>
    <p>Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.</p>
    <p>Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code <b>debugging</b>.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript Debuggers</h2>

    <p>Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.</p>
    <p>Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.</p>
    <p>With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.</p>

    <h2>The console.log() Method</h2>

    <p>If your browser supports debugging, you can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the debugger window:</p>
    
    <p>Activate debugging in your browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox) with F12, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.</p>

    <script>
        a = 5;
        b = 6;
        c = a + b;
        console.log(c);
    </script>

    <h2>Setting Breakpoints</h2>

    <p>In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.</p>
    <p>At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.</p>
    <p>After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).</p>

    <h2>The debugger Keyword</h2>

    <p>The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.</p>
    <p>This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.</p>
    <p>If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.</p>
    <p>With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <p>With the debugger turned on, the code below should stop executing before it executes the third line.</p>

    <script>
        var x = 15 * 5;
        debugger;
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>

    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: 500px;">Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs.</p>
