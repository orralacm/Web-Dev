    <h1>JavaScript Hoisting</h1>

    <p>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted</h2>

    <p>In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.</p>
    <p>In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

        elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element 
        elem.innerHTML = x;           // Display x in the element

        var x; // Declare x
    </script>

    <p>And the following code gives the same result:</p>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <script>
        var x2; // Declare x
        x2 = 5; // Assign 5 to x

        elem = document.getElementById("demo2"); // Find an element 
        elem.innerHTML = x2;           // Display x in the element
    </script>

    <p>To understand this, you have to understand the term "hoisting".</p>
    <p>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).</p>

    <h2>The let and const Keywords</h2>

    <p>Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not <em>initialized</em>.</p>
    <p>Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.</p>
    <p>Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.</p>
    <p>The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:</p>

    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <script>
        try {
        carName = "Volvo";
        let carName;
        document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = carName;
        }
        catch(err) {
        document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = err.name + ": " + err.message;
        }
    </script>

    <p>Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax errror, so the code will simply not run.</p>

    <p id="demo4"></p>

    <script>
        carName2 = "Volvo";
        const carName2;
        document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = carName2;
    </script>

    <h2>JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted</h2>

    <p>JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.</p>

    <p id="demo5"></p>

    <script>
        var xa = 5; // Initialize x
        var ya = 7; // Initialize y

        elem = document.getElementById("demo5"); // Find an element 
        elem.innerHTML = xa + " " + ya;       // Display x and y
    </script>

    <p>The code above won't give the same result as the following piece of code:</p>

    <p id="demo6"></p>
        <script>
        var xb = 5;  // Initialize x

        elem = document.getElementById("demo6");      // Find an element 
        elem.innerHTML = "x is " + xb + " and y is " + yb;  // Display x and y

        var yb = 7;  // Initialize y
    </script>

    <p>This is because only the declaration (var y), not the initialization (=7) is hoisted to the top.</p>
    <p>Because of hoisting, y has been declared before it is used, but because initializations are not hoisted, the value of y is undefined.</p>

    <h2>Declare Your Variables At the Top !</h2>

    <p>Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.</p>
    <p>If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).</p>
    <p>To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.</p>
    <p>Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.</p>
